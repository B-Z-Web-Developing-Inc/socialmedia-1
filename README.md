# socialmedia
This project is offering features typical for social media service.
Allows registration of new users, follow each other, post "tweets" into a dedicated discussion rooms, send private messages, and change avatar. However, real time chat is not implemented (requires refreshing to send request to server) 
As my all my previous projects I used:
<ul>
  <li>Spring Boot</li>
  <li>Spring Security</li>
  <li>Spring Data JPA</li>
  <li>Spring MVC</li>
  <li>Thymeleaf</li>
  <li>HTML + Bootstrap</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Maven as dependency manager </li>
</ul>
Project is still in development phase, so if you would decide to run source code, not all features would work well.
In such case I encourage to contact me for more information.
